# __(English) Acoustic Models__

A fully-connected architecture that's typically used in hybrid HMM-DNN speech recognition systems (English language) for acoustic modeling. Similar to a speech network described in Large Scale Distributed Deep Networks [paper](https://research.google.com/archive/large_deep_networks_nips2012.html).
