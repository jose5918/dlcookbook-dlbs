"""EngAcousticModel model configuration.

References:
  A typical deep fully connected neural network used in hybrid HMM/DNN speech
  recognition system to model acustics (transition from MFCC coefficients to,
  usually, clustered tri-phones).
  We have 8192 classes here (search tf_cnn_benchmarks.py for 'nclass')
  Since we do not work with images, we model input signal by using images of
  size 1x23x23 hat gives 529 features. In other experiments, we work with 540
  features.
